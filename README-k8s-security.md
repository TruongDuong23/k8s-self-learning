# Kubernetes Security
- kube-api: like center, controll all operations in k8s, interact with it through the kube-control utility or by accessing the API directly --> can perform almost operations on the cluster

## Authentication
### Who can access?
By the authentication mechanisms, there are many ways to authenticate to the API server:
- Files - Username and Passwords
- Files - Username and Tokens
- Certificates
- External Authentication providers - LDAP
- Service Accounts
### What can they do?
Authorization is implemented using role-based access controls where users are associated to groups with specific permissions. In addition, there are other authorization modules like the attribute-based access control
- RBAC Authorization
- ABAC Authorization
- Node Authorization
- Webhook Mode
Communication among components is secured using TLS encryption

As we know, there are many nodess, virtual,components... work with together. Beside, we have:
* users like administrators that access the cluster  to perform administrative tasks
* the developers that access the cluster to test or deploy applications
* end users who access the applications deployed on the cluster
* Third party applications (Bots) access the cluster for integration purpose
   
====> To secure our cluster, by securing the communication between internal components and securing management access to the cluster through authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Account
Security of end users, who access the applications deployed on the cluster is managed by the applications themselves, internally.  --> out of discuss

Focus: on users' access to the k8s cluster (admins, usres, bots <-> Service Accounts) for administrative purposes

So we are left with two types of users (users and service account): humans such as the administrators and developers, and robots such as other processes or services or applications that require access to the cluster. 
Kubernetes does not manage user accounts natively. It relies on an external source like a file with user details or certificates or third party identify service like LDAP to manage these users. And so you can not create users in a Kubernetes cluster or view the list of users like this.

However, in case of service accounts, Kubernetes can manage them. You can create and manage service accounts using the k8s API. We have a section on service accounts exclusively where we discuss and practice more about service accounts

### Auth Mechanisms
All user access is managed by the API server whether you're accessing the cluster through kubecontrol tool or the API directly. All of these requets go through the kube-apiserver. The kube-apiserver authenticates the request before processing it. 

So how does the kube-apiserver authenticate?

There are different authentication mechanisms that can be configured. You can have a list of username and password in a static password file or usernames and tokens in a static token file or you can authenticate using certificates. And another option is to connect to third party authentication protocols like LDAP, Kerberos etc...

#### Static password and token files
Let's start with the simplest form of authentication. You can create a list of users and their passwords in a **CSV file** and use that as the code for user information. The fiel has three columns, password, username and user ID. We then pass the file name as an option to the kube-apiserver. Remember kube-apiserver.service and the various options we looked at earlier in this course. That is where you must specify this option **--basic-auth-file=user-details.csv**.

You must then restart the kube-apiserver for these options to take effect. If you set up your cluster using the Kubeadm tool, then you must modify the kube-apiserver POD definition file. The kubeadm tool will automatically restart the kube-apiserver once you update this file

#### Authenticate User
To authenticate using the basic credentials while accessing the API server, specify the user and password in a curl command like this

#### Auth Mechanisms - Basic
In the CSV file with the user details that we saw, we can optionally have a fourth column with the group details to assign users to specific groups

Similarly, instead of a static password file, you can have a static token file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcd5499e-ab36-402e-94b4-e4f2f05bc0f6)

Here instead of password, you specify a token. Pass the token file as an option, tokenauth file to the kube-apiserver. While authenticating specify the token as an authorization barrier token to your request like this

### Note
- This is not a recommended authentication mechanism
- Consider volume mount while providing the auth file in a kubeadm setup
- Set up Role Based Authorization for the new users


## TLS Certitficates (PRE_REQ)
A certificate is used to guarantee trust between two parties during a transaction. For example, when a user tries to access a web server, TLS certificates ensure that the communication between the user and the server is encrypted and the server is who it says it is.
